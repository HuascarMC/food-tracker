## Setting Up The Development Environment

    `git clone repolink`

3. Set up git

      - `git remote add upstream original repo link`
      ```
        // make sure there are 2 remotes (origin that points to your fork and upstream for the original repo)
        git remote -v
      ```

    - **everytime you start working on a new feature, run: `git pull upstream develop` which ensures you are always working with the most updated version of the project.**

    - create a new branch `git checkout -b new-feature-name`

## Working On Issues

Issues can be found on our Trello board which gives a more visual representation of progress than Github.List: [**Trello**](https://trello.com/b/j7YQcRaF/audem) and not github (use github only to open issues!).

*if you decide to work on an issue please click 'members' and add your name to it, then move it into the 'sprint' queue. (Don't forget to move it into te 'complete' list when finished, and also close the issue in Github.
